**Important Notes**
- In this project, underscores (_) are used as a convention to improve readability and clarity of method and variable names. The underscore has no special significance beyond helping to visually distinguish these members as internal or for organizational purposes.
- In this project, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern has been implemented to structure the code in a modular and maintainable way. This pattern separates the application into three main components:
  - **Model:** Responsible for fetching and storing data.
  - **View**: Responsible for displaying data and user interface.
  - **Controller:** Responsible for updating the Model and View. (a bridge between Model and View)
